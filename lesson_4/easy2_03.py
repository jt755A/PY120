What are the benefits of using object-oriented programming in Python? 
Think of as many as you can.
'''
'''
1. Reusability in other programs; other users
2. Maintainbility/future proofing: allows small changes to made without 
breaking functionality
3. Defining custom classes/methods allows more tailored approach than
just using the built in classes/methods
4. Areas of code can be sectioned off: a whole program doesn't depend on 
entire body of code.
5. Allows more efficient writing: code can be re-used
6. Classes/objects are more abstract than hard coding. Works more at the 
problem domain
